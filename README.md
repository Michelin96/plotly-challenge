# plotly-challenge
Creates plots that change dynamically with data selected from a list.

# Synopis and Usage

An interactive web page was created for observing the samples.json dataset. One-hundred and fifty-three test subjects, identifed by an ID number, had their microbes that colonize in human navels cataloged. Demographics for each subject are recorded, including the belly button type (bbtype) and how many times per week the belly button is washed (wfreq).

The top ten belly button bacteri strains for each subject are plotted in a bar chart and identified by their OTU (operational taxonomic units) number. A bubble chart shows how many of each strain was found. Hovering over each bubble will show the full name of that bacteri strain as well as actual count.

The default data from the first test subject in the list. Clicking the drop down arrow and selecting a new ID number will update the plots and demegraphics for that test subject.
